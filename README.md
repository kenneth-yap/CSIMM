# Computational Science Investigation for Material Mechanics (CSI:MM)

This repository was produced as part of the CSI:MM inidividual project at ETH Zurich, co-supervised by Prof. David Kammer and Dr. Falk Wittel. The goal of the notebook was to obtain the Prony Series coefficients of a concrete sample for a given strain evolution.
